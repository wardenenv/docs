# PHP SPX Profiling

PHP SPX is a simple, free and open source profiler. It covers both FPM and CLI requests, and provides a built-in UI to visualise the generated reports. Of which a [demo can be seen here](https://noisebynorthwest.github.io/php-spx/demo/report.html?key=spx-full-20191229_175636-06d2fe5ee423-3795-233665123).

For more information, please see the [PHP SPX Github Repository](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx).


## Configuration


To enable PHP SPX in your project environment, add to your `.env` file:
```
WARDEN_PHP_SPX=1
```

## Usage

### CLI

Running the `warden spx` command, will place you within a PHP-SPX instrumented terminal. Where any PHP commands you run will be profiled.

You should see a SPX report printed after the command finishes. And there will also be a corresponding report within the control panel.

### Web

Once an environment is started with the `WARDEN_PHP_SPX=1` flag set, all web requests will be profiled. To override this, you can uncheck the `Automatic start` option within the control panel.

### Control Panel / Viewer

To view the reports generated by PHP SPX, append `?SPX_UI_URI=/` to the end of your environment url (e.g `https://app.magento2.test/?SPX_UI_URI=/`).
