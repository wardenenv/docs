Under the hood `docker-compose` is used to control everything which Warden runs (shared services as well as per-project containers) via the Docker Engine.

## Features

* Traefik for SSL termination and routing/proxying requests into the correct containers.
* Portainer for quick visibility into what's running inside the local Docker host.
* Dnsmasq to serve DNS responses for `.test` domains eliminating manual editing of `/etc/hosts`
* An SSH tunnel for connecting from Sequel Pro or TablePlus into any one of multiple running database containers.
* Warden issued wildcard SSL certificates for running https on all local development domains.
* Full support for Magento 1, Magento 2, Laravel, Symfony 4, Shopware 6 on both macOS and Linux.
* Ability to override, extend, or setup completely custom environment definitions on a per-project basis.
